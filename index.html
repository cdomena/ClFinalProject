	<h1>Chris Domena</h1>
		<p>My name is Chris (you probably figured that out already) and this is my testing site. I am a technology / art junkie who never gave up on his toy collection. </p>
		<p>Interests ranging from wax sculpting to digital design, I keep myself busy with new and increasingly more ludicrous ideas for projects. 
		Inspired by Saturday morning cartoons and the artists who brought them to life. Trailblazers in pushing the boundaries of where imagination meets reality.

	<h2>Who am I?</h2>
		  <p>I grew up in Miami, Florida and have my brothers to thank for driving my love of art. They built models, painted murals and were cool enough to include me on the projects. After graduation I started work in the IT field and manage to mix work with my hobbies when possible.

	<h2>What I do</h2>
		  <p>The short answer is just having fun and try to put my ideas to good use. Initially I thought it would be cool to design shirts and posters for friends and family but that wasnâ€™t really a sustainable hobby. Through some chance meetings I was introduced to sculpting and how it can be used to design custom figures. So as usual I took up the challenge and picked up the basic tools to give it a shot.
