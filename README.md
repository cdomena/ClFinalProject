Code Louisville May 2018 FEWD

I created a simple template for a personal site to test out various HTML/CSS/JS code. Over time I'll add a bit more polish as I dig deeper in design and animation.

You can either download the files/folders and open the "index.html" or view through the GitHub pages link https://cdomena.github.io/ClFinalProject/

Javascript example is in The about page (stuff.html). Magic 8 ball generator.



*Oddly the folder name is case sensitive for the GitHub pages link.
