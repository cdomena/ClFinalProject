	<h1>Projects I worked on</h1>
		<p>Over the past few years I've dabbled in different art mediums and all for fun. I started with sketch and over time decided that it would be awesome to actually have a figure of the characters I drew. So I tried sculpting in clay but just didnt feel comfortable nd finally found a wax/clay hybrid called Castilene wax. No need for an armature and can hold incredible detail.
